# APS360

for all code, I expect tabs for indent instead of spaces
and you should be using the latest version of python (3.11.4)

also make sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages
you might have to install `pytorch` manually if you don't have Nvidia GPU

to generate/process the data your going to have to run `data.ipynb`, you can disable the compression to save time
